# **System Overview**

The system consists of three key components:

1. **Arduino UNO**: The heart of the system, responsible for reading the potentiometer's analog signal and translating it into a PWM signal to control the LED's brightness.
2. **Potentiometer**: A variable resistor that allows us to generate an adjustable voltage level. Rotating its knob changes the analog signal, which the Arduino reads and processes.
3. **LED**: A light-emitting diode whose brightness is controlled by the Arduino's PWM output.

By rotating the potentiometer, we can dynamically adjust the brightness of the LED, making this project both engaging and practical.

# **Principle of Operation**

The system operates by utilizing the **analog-to-digital conversion (ADC)** capabilities of the Arduino UNO. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what happens:

1. **Reading the Potentiometer**: The potentiometer acts as a voltage divider, providing a variable voltage between 0V and 5V, depending on the position of its knob. This voltage is read by the Arduino on an **analog pin (A0)**.
2. **Mapping the Signal**: The Arduino converts the analog signal (ranging from 0 to 1023, as it is a 10-bit ADC) into a value suitable for controlling the LED's brightness (ranging from 0 to 255).
3. **Controlling the LED with PWM**: The mapped value is used to generate a PWM signal on a digital pin connected to the LED. PWM effectively modulates the power delivered to the LED, controlling its brightness.

The beauty of the system lies in its simplicity: the potentiometer provides user input, the Arduino processes this input, and the LED responds in real-time.



# üß≤ **Physics Principle**  
A **potentiometer** is a three-terminal variable resistor that acts as a **voltage divider**. Its operation relies on Ohm‚Äôs Law (*V = I √ó R*) and the principle of **resistive voltage division**.  

- **Structure**:  
  - A resistive track (e.g., carbon or conductive plastic) with fixed total resistance (*R_total*).  
  - A wiper (movable contact) that slides along the track, splitting it into two resistances (*R‚ÇÅ* and *R‚ÇÇ*).  

- **Voltage Division**:  
  When a voltage (*V_in*) is applied across the potentiometer‚Äôs outer terminals, the output voltage (*V_out*) at the wiper is:  

**V_out = V_in √ó (R‚ÇÇ / (R‚ÇÅ + R‚ÇÇ))**

## üîß **Engineering Design**  
Potentiometers are designed for precision, durability, and linearity:  
- **Materials**: Resistive tracks use materials like cermet, conductive plastic, or wirewound elements.  
- **Types**: Rotary (knob) or linear (slider).  
- **Key Parameters**:  
- **Total Resistance** (e.g., 10kŒ©).  
- **Taper**: Linear (B) or logarithmic (A) response.  
- **Resolution**: Smoothness of voltage adjustment.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Noise & Stability**: Mechanical wear or dust can cause signal fluctuations. Use shielded wiring for critical applications.

## **Understanding the Code**

The code is divided into two main sections: **setup** and **loop**. Let's examine each in detail.

### **1. Setup Function: Configuration and Calibration**

The `setup()` function initializes the system and performs a **calibration step** to determine the potentiometer's minimum and maximum values. This ensures accurate mapping of the potentiometer's range to the LED's brightness levels.

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);          // Configure the LED pin as an output
  Serial.begin(9600);               // Start serial communication for debugging

  Serial.println("Calibration... Turn the potentiometer from minimum to maximum");
  unsigned long startTime = millis();
  while (millis() - startTime < 5000) { // 5 seconds for calibration
    val = analogRead(analogPin);       // Read the potentiometer's value
    if (val < minVal) minVal = val;    // Update the minimum value
    if (val > maxVal) maxVal = val;    // Update the maximum value
    delay(10);                         // Small delay for stability
  }

  // Print calibration results
  Serial.print("Minimum value :  ");
  Serial.println(minVal);
  Serial.print("Maximum value :  ");
  Serial.println(maxVal);
}
```

#### **Key Points**:
- The potentiometer is read repeatedly for 5 seconds to capture its full range of motion.
- The minimum (`minVal`) and maximum (`maxVal`) values are dynamically updated during this calibration phase.
- Results are displayed on the Serial Monitor, aiding in debugging and ensuring the calibration's accuracy.

### **2. Loop Function: Dynamic Brightness Control**

The `loop()` function continuously reads the potentiometer's value, maps it to the LED's brightness range, and updates the LED's brightness in real-time.

```cpp
void loop() {
  val = analogRead(analogPin);          // Read the potentiometer's value
  Serial.println(val);                  // Output the raw value for debugging
  int mappedVal = map(val, minVal, maxVal, 0, 255); // Map to 0‚Äì255 range
  mappedVal = constrain(mappedVal, 0, 255); // Constrain to valid range
  analogWrite(ledPin, mappedVal);       // Adjust LED brightness
}
```

#### **Key Points**:
- The **`analogRead()`** function captures the current state of the potentiometer.
- The **`map()`** function scales the potentiometer's value to the 0‚Äì255 range required for PWM.
- The **`analogWrite()`** function generates a PWM signal to control the LED's brightness.

By continuously looping, this function allows for a seamless and responsive interaction between the potentiometer and the LED.

## **How It All Comes Together**

When you upload this code to your Arduino UNO and connect the hardware components as described, the system springs to life. Upon powering the Arduino, the following sequence occurs:

1. **Calibration Phase**: The Serial Monitor prompts you to rotate the potentiometer's knob fully during the first 5 seconds. This step ensures that the Arduino accurately maps the potentiometer's range.
2. **Real-Time Control**: After calibration, the potentiometer's position directly influences the LED's brightness. Turning the knob clockwise increases brightness, while counterclockwise reduces it.

The result is an intuitive, responsive system that demonstrates the elegance of analog input and PWM output.

## **Hardware Connections**

To replicate this project, ensure the following connections are made:

1. **Potentiometer**:
   - One side terminal to **GND**.
   - The other side terminal to **5V**.
   - The middle terminal (wiper) to **A0** on the Arduino.

2. **LED**:
   - The longer leg (anode) to **digital pin 3** (via a limiting resistor, typically 220Œ©).
   - The shorter leg (cathode) to **GND**.

## **Conclusion**

This project elegantly showcases how a simple potentiometer can be used to control an LED's brightness, combining the power of analog input, signal mapping, and PWM output. It not only introduces key concepts like calibration and signal mapping but also serves as a stepping stone for more advanced Arduino projects.
